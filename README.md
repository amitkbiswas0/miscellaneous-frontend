# Front-end Miscellaneous

Some front-end projects I made using Vanilla **HTML5/CSS3/JS6** and/or Frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Each folder is a self-contained separate project which can be downloaded and used separately. Feel free to use any piece of code here for personal/commercial purposes
